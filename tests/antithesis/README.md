# Antithesis Testing

This package supports testing with
[Antithesis](https://antithesis.com/docs/introduction/introduction.html),
a SaaS offering that enables deployment of distributed systems (such
as Lux) to a deterministic and simulated environment that
enables discovery and reproduction of anomalous behavior.

See luxd's
[documentation](https://github.com/luxfi/luxd/blob/master/tests/antithesis/README.md)
for more details.
