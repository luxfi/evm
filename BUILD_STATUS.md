# Build Status Report - Lux EVM Module

## Date: 2025-08-18

## Summary
The EVM module currently **DOES NOT BUILD** due to fundamental interface incompatibilities between the local consensus package and node v1.16.15.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Interface Version Mismatch
- **Problem**: EVM was designed for older interface versions (similar to avalanchego v1.13.4)
- **Current State**: Trying to use node v1.16.15 with incompatible interfaces
- **Impact**: Multiple build errors across VM initialization and block interfaces

### 2. Specific Build Errors

#### Initialize Method Incompatibility
```
Expected by node v1.16.15:
Initialize(ctx context.Context, chainCtx *consensus.Context, db database.Database, ...)

Current EVM implementation:
Initialize(_ context.Context, chainCtx context.Context, db database.Database, ...)
```

#### Block Interface Conflicts
- `protocol/chain.Block` expects `ID() ids.ID`
- `consensus/chain.Block` expects `ID() string`
- Cannot implement both simultaneously

#### Factory Interface Issues
- Node's vms.Factory expects `New(luxfi/log.Logger)`
- Implementation provides `New(node/utils/logging.Logger)`

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Created Wrapper Types**
   - `consensusBlockWrapper` - Partial success
   - `ConsensusFactory` - Not fully compatible

2. **Added Missing Methods**
   - `GetBlock`, `ParseBlock`, `LastAccepted` - Added but type signatures don't match

3. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Changed from `node/upgrade` to `node/vms/platformvm/upgrade`
   - Fixed some config issues but revealed deeper incompatibilities

## Root Cause
The EVM module is mixing two incompatible systems:
1. Local consensus package (custom implementation)
2. Node v1.16.15 (official Lux node)

These have fundamentally different VM interfaces that cannot be reconciled without major refactoring.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Compatible Versions
Downgrade to node v1.13.4 equivalent which matches the EVM's interface expectations.

### Option 2: Major Refactoring
Completely rewrite the VM implementation to match node v1.16.15 interfaces:
- Replace context.Context with *consensus.Context
- Update all method signatures
- Remove dependency on local consensus package

### Option 3: Fork Approach
Maintain a forked version of node with compatible interfaces.

## Next Steps
1. **Decision Required**: Choose approach (compatibility vs refactoring)
2. **If refactoring**: Estimated 2-3 days of work to update all interfaces
3. **If compatibility**: Revert to v1.13.4 and ensure all modules use matching versions

## Current Module Versions
- node: v1.16.15 (incompatible)
- consensus: v1.16.15-lux (local, incompatible with node)
- crypto: v1.16.15-lux (local)
- warp: v1.16.15-lux (local)
- geth: v1.16.2-lux.4

## Files Requiring Major Changes
1. `plugin/evm/vm.go` - Initialize method and all VM interface methods
2. `plugin/evm/block.go` - Block interface implementations
3. `plugin/evm/factory.go` - Factory interface
4. All files importing consensus package interfaces

## Build Command
```bash
cd /home/z/work/lux/evm
go build ./...
```

## Error Count
- Total errors: 15+
- Interface mismatches: 8
- Type incompatibilities: 7
